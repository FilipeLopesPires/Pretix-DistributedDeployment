## Description:

The aim of this project is to deploy and manage a distributed product of an already existing open-source solution.
The system will have a fully-automatic deployment pipeline and will be fault tolerant.
We intend to provide a report on the work developed, the source code and the respective documentation.

The product provided is Pretix (https://github.com/pretix/pretix), a ticket shop application for conferences, festivals, tech events, etc.
Persistance will be done using PostgreSQL, caching using Redis and communications with the product will resort to Pretix's REST API.

## Deployment Instructions
