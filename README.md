# Distributed Deployment and Management of <br /> [Pretix - a Ticket Shop Application](https://github.com/pretix)

## Description

This project allows the deployment and management of a distributed open-source product.
The product provided is [Pretix](https://github.com/pretix/pretix), a ticket shop application for conferences, festivals, tech events, etc.
The system has a fully-automatic deployment pipeline and is fault tolerant.
We provide reports on the work developed, the source code and the respective documentation.

Persistence is done using a PostgreSQL cluster, caching using a Redis cluster and communications with the product resort to Pretix's REST API.
Load balancing is done with NGinX implemented both inside Pretix and outside to distribute load amongst a set of endpoints.
The deployed service is hosted in a Docker Compose Swarm.
