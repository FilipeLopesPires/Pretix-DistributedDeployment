% who did what?

Regarding the work distribution amongst developers, a close-contact strategy was defined where each worked on a cluster component or piece of software according 
to a predefined plan. 
The cluster strategy and respective details were decided in conjunction, as well as the key objectives and tasks to be achieved before the final delivery deadline.
... were also implemented collectively.

Nevertheless, some relatively independent task distribution was defined: ...
Bug and error solving was made along the development phase by both developers any time it was required.

Once performance benchmarking and bottleneck identification were completed, this report and the code documentation became our primary concern, with both 
contributing equally.
